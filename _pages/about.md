Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in **Applied Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)**.  

Currently, Iâ€™m a **researcher** at the **[Data & Language Intelligence Laboratory (DLI)](https://dli.skku.edu/)**, advised by **Prof. YunSeok Choi**, where I study **knowledge distillation** and **multimodal fusion** for efficient and interpretable AI systems.  

Previously, I worked as a **researcher** at the **[Digital Environment Human Behavior Lab (DEHUB)](https://swb.skku.edu/dehublab/index.do)**, advised by **Prof. Daeho Lee**, focusing on **NLP-driven time-series forecasting**.  

Iâ€™m also grateful to have been selected as a **Presidential Science Scholar**, and Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and research discussions.
